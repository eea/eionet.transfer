To be implemented:
* Unit tests on database integration
* HTML5 (or JQuery) upload progress bar, see http://www.matlus.com/html5-file-upload-with-progress/
* Graceful recovery if there is not enough space for storage
* HTML file drag and drop
* Table for authorisations
* CAS login
* Check for thread safety
* Nicer user interface
* Must be able to handle 5 GB uploads
* The embedded h2 server doesn't like war redeployments. Perhaps start up the TCP server? See http://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#spring
