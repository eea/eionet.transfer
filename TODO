Ideas to be implemented:
* Graceful recovery if there is not enough space for storage
* Graceful message if user tries to use delete link a second time
* HTML file drag and drop
* Check for thread safety
* Nicer user interface
* Verify the fileTTL is max 3 months.
* Find a place where the administrator can see how much disk space is available for uploads
* Warn if the in-progress upload location for the file is on a different file system than the longterm storage as it would incur delays.
